# QR-Code-Reader

This project is a QR-code scanner to track how many and who is attending
[MelbPC](https://www.melbpc.org.au/) events.


## Hardware

To run this project as it's designed; as a stand-alone scanner, you'll
need the following hardware:

* [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
* QR-Code Scanner - simply acts as a USB keyboard
* Touch Screen - HDMI interface to Raspberry Pi
* Keyboard (USB) [optional]
* Mouse (USB) [optional]

However, to just test things out, all you'll need is a computer
running Linux (preferably debian based, to directly match `apt` commands).

## Setup

* [Initial Setup](doc/setup.md)
* [Update Software](doc/update.md)
