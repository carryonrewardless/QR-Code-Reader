**The intention of this section** is to document the work to create a local copy of the membership database from CiviCRM data.

This is the CiviCRM API generated URL but **does not work**.
'https://www.melbpc.org.au/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/rest.php?entity=Membership&action=get&api_key=userkey&key=sitekey&json={"sequential":1,"return":"contact_id.id,contact_id.last_name,contact_id.first_name,contact_id.postal_code,contact_id.custom_8,end_date,status_id.name"}'

What works is 
'https://www.melbpc.org.au/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/rest.php?entity=Contact&action=get&api_key=userKey&key=sitekey&json=contact_id&return=contact_id,last_name,first_name,postal_code,custom_8&api.Membership.get[custom_8,end_date,status_id.name]&options[limit]=0'

Result is a JSON file with content like this per member:
' "855":{"contact_id":"855","first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Brown","contact_is_deleted":"0","address_id":"837","postal_code":"3124","civicrm_value_membership_information_4_id":"811","custom_8":"45170","id":"855","api_Membership_get":{"is_error":0,"version":3,"count":1,"id":842,"values":[{"id":"842","contact_id":"855","membership_type_id":"1","join_date":"2006-12-14","start_date":"2017-01-02","end_date":"2020-01-01","status_id":"2","is_test":"0","is_pay_later":"0","membership_name":"Individual","relationship_name":"Child of"}]}},"856":'
 
 with the api_Membership_get part arising from the table join to get the required fields.
 Which is messy because of the table join to get end_date and status_id.

I then use a wget -O members-list.json https://www.melbpc.org.au ..................... 
to create a local copy.

I was intending to use a python script to load the required fields and write them to a MariaDB file on the Rasp Pi from this but 
is made difficult (for me) because of the joined fields.
See my ReadFromJSON.py

Another option to pursue is to use this query 
'https://www.melbpc.org.au/index.php/qrcheck/?contact_id=855'
and python's Beautiful Soup and requests but to pull in from 3000 records could be very slow.  150 records took  a couple of minutes whereas the API route is very quick.
